# cli-tool
This CLI tool streamlines the organization of files and media within a folder or directory, grouping them into sub-folders for a more organized user environment. Additionally, it can arrange files in a tree structure with branches and nodes.

It has three main commands:
- **HELP** lists all available commands.
- **ORGANIZE** consolidates all files/sub-folders in a directory based on their file types.
- **TREE** structures files into a tree format, including branches and nodes.

The implementation in the code editor is as follows:
